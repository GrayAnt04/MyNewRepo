        <p>My favourite Activities and Hobbies</p>

        <p>- <a href="https://www.sksprops.com">Cosplay</a></p>
        <img style="max-width: 200px; max-height: 200px; padding: 10px 0px 0px 0px;" src="cosplay.jpg">
        <p>Cosplay is a mix between the two words "costume" and "play". This is because most people who wear these costumes also act like the characters their dressed as. Most people also make their own cosplay so it tends to be a long and expensive project. I have made many cosplays ranging from a knight named solaire to chainsaw man (as seen above).</p>

        <p>- <a href="https://store.steampowered.com">Gaming</a></p>
        <img style="max-width: 200px; max-height: 200px; padding: 10px 0px 0px 0px;" src="gaming.jpg">
        <p>Gaming is the action of playing some kind of game. This is usually in reference to card games, board games, and video games. My favorite of the three would have to be video games. By far my favorite game series would have to be the dark souls trilogy by Fromsoft.</p>

        <p>- <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/">Cooking</a></p>
        <img style="max-width: 200px; max-height: 200px; padding: 10px 0px 0px 0px;" src="cooking.jpg">
        <p>Cooking is the practice of preparing food by manipulating ingtredients. There is a wide range of food that can be cooked but most fall into the catagories of breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. My favorite thing that I have cooked would have to be japanese pancakes. The difference is that they are fluffier and less dense.</p>

        <p>- <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com">3D Printing</a></p>
        <img style="max-width: 200px; max-height: 200px; padding: 10px 0px 0px 0px;" src="3dprinting.jpg">
        <p>3D Printing is the action of creating a physical object, layher by layer, from a digital model. 3D modeling can be useful for many situations ranging from prototyping to creating pieces for personal projects. One of my favorite things that I have printed before is a figure of ornstien from dark souls I.</p>
